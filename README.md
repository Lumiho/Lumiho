👋 Hi, I'm Leonardo Zavala-Jimenez

I'm a Computer Science student at UC Davis minoring in Statistics, passionate about AI, data-driven systems, and full-stack development. I love building intelligent systems that connect hardware, data, and software — from EMG-powered fitness apps to custom microservices.

🎓 National Outreach Coordinator & Project Lead at ColorStack, where I mentor students and lead initiatives that support underrepresented communities in tech.

💻 Experienced in software engineering, machine learning, and data analysis, with hands-on projects in React Native, Node.js, Python, Rust, and C.

📱 Currently building MuscleMax, an EMG-based fitness platform using React Native + Expo, BLE hardware, SQLite, and a custom Node/Express + ResilientDB backend.

🌐 Developing Top Garden, a full-stack landscaping web app using React, Tailwind, and Node.js.

🧠 Strong foundation in algorithms, regression modeling, and AI — paired with practical experience debugging Bluetooth systems, writing microservices, and fine-tuning TTS models.

🛠️ Skilled with Python, Java, C/C++, R, TypeScript, SQL, GitHub, Tailwind, and embedded development tools.

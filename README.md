I'm a Computer Science student at UC Davis with a strong interest in **Data Science**, **Software Engineering**, and **Project Management** — and a passion for playing the violin (albeit not that well).

- 🎓 **National Outreach Coordinator** and **Project Lead** at [ColorStack](https://www.colorstack.org/), where I help empower underrepresented students in tech through mentorship and outreach.
- 💻 I have vast tutoring experience — from being a club tutor at UC Davis to tutoring high school students!
- 🛠️ Currently building a **website and startup project** that combine my interests in tech, data, and community impact.
- 🧠 Experienced with **Python**, **C++**, **R**, **SQL**, and **GitHub**.
